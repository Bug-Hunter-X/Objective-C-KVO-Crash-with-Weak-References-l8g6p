In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and the memory management system, specifically when dealing with weak references.  If an object is observed through a weak reference and that object is deallocated while the observer is still active, it can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior. The observer might try to access the deallocated object, resulting in an exception.

Example:

```objectivec
@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyObservedObject *observedObject;
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // Accessing observedObject here after it's deallocated can cause a crash
    NSLog (@"Value changed: %@
", [self.observedObject someProperty]);
}
@end

@interface MyObservedObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *someProperty;
@end

@implementation MyObservedObject
// ...
@end
```
