# Objective-C KVO Crash with Weak References

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and weak references. When an observer holds a weak reference to an observed object, and that object is deallocated while the observer is still active, attempting to access the object's properties can lead to a crash.

The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The issue stems from accessing the observed object after it has been deallocated.  Since the observer uses a weak reference, the reference will become nil after the deallocation, but the observer might not immediately stop observing, leading to accessing a nil object, resulting in a crash.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the observation lifecycle. The observer should either stop observing the object when it detects that the object's reference has become nil or use a strong reference for the duration of observation with proper management to avoid retain cycles.
